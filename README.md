### Hi there 👋

Working with Data is not new thing to me. Working in soccer in the U.S. and England, making high-impact decisions based on intuition and objective measurements that can affect wins/losses, revenue, an active roster, and fan reception, I've had the privelege of making a career transition to dive even deeper in the world of processing and analyizing data. Whether it was using GPS systems to measure metrics during training or a game, or measuring blood oxygen levels through NIRS devices on the skin, I had some use of data to help me make important decisions.

I was recently let go from Modo Bio, a remote patient monitoring company, due to a company-wide shutdown. Taking in data from wearable devices, such as sleep, step count, blood glucose, and heart rate, we could collectively build out health profiles for patient data ownership. 

## About me:
- 🌱 I’m currently working in Backend development. Skills: Python, Docker, Postgres, FastAPI.
- 📈 Love all things Data. Working with Arizona Water Data (demand vs supply) in active management areas for a small project.
- 🤔 I’m currently looking for employment, as my most recent position was cut due to a company shutdown.
- 💬 Ask me about what it is like to transition careers and all about personal development. This isn't my first rodeo. I actually attended dental school for 2 months before voluntarily dropping out.
