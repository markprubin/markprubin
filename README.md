### Hi there 👋

Working with Data has always been prevalent in my career, especially in the sports performance world. Working in professional soccer in the U.S. and England, making high-impact decisions based on intuition and objective measurements that can affect wins/losses, revenue, an active roster, and fan reception, I've had the privelege of making a career transition to dive even deeper in the world of processing and analyizing data. Whether it was using GPS systems to measure metrics during training or a game, or measuring blood oxygen levels through NIRS devices on the skin, I had data available to help make important decisions.

I was recently let go from Modo Bio, a remote patient monitoring company, due to a company-wide shutdown. Taking in data from wearable devices, such as sleep, step count, blood glucose, and heart rate, we could collectively build out health profiles for patient data ownership. So my goal is to continue the momentum of my data and backend engineering career.

## About me:
- 🌱 I’m currently working in Backend development. Skills: Python, Docker, Postgres, FastAPI.
- 📈 Love all things Data. These are some things I am working on:
  1. A brewery app that not only ingests an API with a large dataset, but also takes in additional breweries.
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis on Formula 1 data sets, including circuit data, as well as individual and team results throughout the 2023 season.
- 🤔 I’m currently looking for employment, as my most recent position was cut due to a company shutdown.
