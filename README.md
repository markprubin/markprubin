### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am brand new to the world of Software Engineering. I am a recent graduate from the Actualize Coding Bootcamp. I am transitioning from a career in Strength & Conditioning and Personal Training to Software Development. 

## About me:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all about full stack development, where we are connecting the backend and front end.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with navigating the software development world and employment.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what it is like to transition careers and all about personal development. This isn't my first rodeo. I actually attended dental school for 2 months before voluntarily dropping out.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [markrubin.dev](www.markrubin.dev)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a German native and am bilingual.
