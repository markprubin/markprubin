### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am brand new to the world of Software Engineering. 

## About me:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working in Backend development. Skills: Python, Docker, Postgres, FastAPI.
- ðŸ“ˆ Love all things Data. Working with Arizona Water Data (demand vs supply) in active management areas for a small project.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m currently looking for employment, as my most recent position was cut due to a company shutdown.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what it is like to transition careers and all about personal development. This isn't my first rodeo. I actually attended dental school for 2 months before voluntarily dropping out.
