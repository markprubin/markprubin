### Hi there 👋

Working with data has always been prevalent in my career, especially in the sports performance world. I've had the privelege of working in professional soccer in England's Premier League and Championship, as well as the U.S.'s USL, where I was making high-impact decisions based on intuition and objective measurements which affected wins/losses, revenue, an active roster, player health, and fan reception. After a successful career in sports performance, I made the decision to carry out a career transition to dive even deeper in the world of processing and analyzing data. Whether it was using GPS systems to measure metrics during training or a game, or measuring blood oxygen levels through NIRS devices on the skin, I had data available to help make important decisions, and a newfound appreciation for the skills I developing now.

I was recently let go from Modo Bio, a remote patient monitoring company, due to a company-wide shutdown, as a Software Engineer/Delivery Lead. Taking in data from wearable devices, such as sleep, step count, blood glucose, and heart rate, we could collectively build out health profiles for patient data ownership. So my goal is to continue the momentum of my data and backend engineering career.

## About me:
- 🌱 I’m currently working in Data Analytics and Visualization. Skills: Python, SQL, Docker, Postgres, MySQL, Tableau FastAPI.
- 📈 Love all things Data. These are some things I am working on:
  1. Exploratory Data Analysis on Formula 1 data sets, including circuit data, as well as individual and team results throughout the 2023 season.
